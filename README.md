# Master API Docs
The API documentation for all Mobi API endpoints. The documentation was created with API Blueprint (https://apiblueprint.org/) and we also offer a swagger version created with apib2swagger (https://github.com/kminami/apib2swagger).

The API documentation page can be accessed at https://takemobiteam.github.io/master-api-docs/ (created with https://github.com/funbox/blueprinter).
